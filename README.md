### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I absolutely LOVE working with React and TypeScript, and at the moment I'm building something with Next.js to learn it well and so far I'm really enjoying the experience.

I've also used to work with Angular, RxJS, ASP.NET, C#.NET, C++ and C - but in the last 4 years I've been focusing a lot more on Fontend Dvelopment along with Design Systems and Accessibility.
